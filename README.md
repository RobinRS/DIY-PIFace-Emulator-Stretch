# DIY-PIFace-Emulator-Stretch
I can't find any versions from the PIFace Emulator from Raspbian Stretch, i programmed my own!

It works for the PIFace Digital 2
But it can also work for the first version, i didn't have one so i can't test it

# Install

Download the python program, start it and it will work

# Dependency 
Install pifacecommon and pifacedigitalo:

$ pip install pifacecommon
$ pip install pifacedigitalio
